### Hello fellow developer / Curious person 👋🏻

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and I'm in love with it.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting a job as a self taught developer

- ⚡ Fun Fact: I'm a self taught developer with a huge passion for technology. My learning journey lead me to really interesting knowledge about many more things that I didn't expect and I'm still learning many many things until this day 'cause, of course, it's never enough :) .
